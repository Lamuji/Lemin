Introduction

For the smooth running of this evaluation, please respect the following rules:

- Remain polite, kind, respectful and constructive whatever happens during
this conversation. It's a matter of confidence between you and the
42 community.

- Highlight the potential problems you ‘ve had with the work you're presented
to the person or the group you're grading, and take the time to talk about
and discuss those issues.

- Accept the fact that the exam subject or required functions might lead
to different interpretations. Listen to your discussion partner's
perspective with an open mind (are they right or wrong ?) and grade them as
fairly as possible.
42's teaching methods can make sense only if peer-evaluation is
taken seriously.
Guidelines

- You must only evaluate what you will find in the student's or group's
GiT repository.

- Take the time to check that the GiT repository matches the student or
group and the project.

- Double check that no malicious alias was used to mislead you and make you
grade something different from the official repository content.

- If a script supposed to help evaluate the exam is supplied by either side, the
other side will have to strictly check it to avoid nasty surprises.

- If the evaluating student has not yet taken this project, they will have to
read the exam subject in its entirety before starting the evaluation.

- Use the flags available on this grading system to signal an empty or non-
funcional project, a norm flaw, cheating, etc. In that case, evaluation stops
and final grade is 0 (or -42 if it's a cheating problem). However, if it's
not a cheating problem, you are invited to keep talking about the work that
has been done (or not done, as a matter of fact) in order to identify the
issues that lead to this stalemate and avoid it next time.

Game functionalities
Preliminaries
Any credentials, API keys, environment variables must be set inside a .env file during the evaluation. In case any credentials, API keys are available in the git repository and outside of the .env file created during the evaluation, the evaluation stop and the mark is 0.
If at any time during defense, there is any warning, error or
notice in the web console, click on the "Crash" button at the
top of the scale. An error code from 500 to 599 is also
considered a Crash.

Make sure aswell that the DB is not a NoSQL type of database.
No error tracking library must be present on the repo (Raven, Sentry)
No 500 errors allowed, dont try to hide them.

Running the game in solo mode
A player can join a new game and launch it.
The access URL to a game is managed using BrowserRouter, MemoryRouter or
whichever you feel is reliable and secure.

exemple: http://<server_name_or_ip>:<port>/<room>/<player_name>

Launching the game in multiplayer mode
Multiple players can join a new game. Only the first one can launch it. A
player cannot join a game in progress. The game is faithful to the
principles of Tetris. The game is over when on player is left.

Relaunch a game
At the end of a game, only the top player of the game can relaunch it. If
this player has left the game, a new player replaces them and can launch
a new game instead. After the end of a game and before relaunching it,
new players can join the game.

Blocks dispatch
During a game, players receive the same sequence of blocks in the same
position and coordinates.

Moving the blocks
Blocks rotate, move to the left, to the right, and fall as indicated in
the documentation. You can move a block during a timer tick once it's
landed, except if you forced the fall.

Line injection
When a player destroys lines, opponents receive a n - 1 line malus. They
are indestructible and appear at the base of their structure.

Graphic interface
Respect of the HTML / DOM constraints
A flexbox or a grid layout is used instead of a <TABLE/> tag. No use of canvas or
SVG. No DOM handling library usage.

Spectres visualization
In multiplayer mode, it is possible to identify the opponents thanks to
their names and observe the specter of their structure. Each modification
of an opponent's structure shows in their spectre.

Client implementation
Socket.io encapsulation
The use of a socket.io must be completely encapsulated in a middleware.

Functional programming
Never call this except to define new 'error' sub-classes. All the logic
relative to the load management of the blocks must be written as pure
functions.

Server implementation
Objet oriented programming
Games and players management server logic must be implemented as
object programming.

Unitary tests
Sufficient cover
The npm run coverage command must indicate that tests cover at least
70% of the statements, functions, lines and at least 50% of the branches.

Bonus
Bonus will be taken into account only if the mandatory part is PERFECT. PERFECT meaning it is completed, that its behavior cannot be faulted, even because of the slightest mistake, improper use, etc... Practically, it means that if the mandatory part is not validated, none of the bonus will be taken in consideration.

Bonuses
In this part, you will count the bonuses proposed by the subject or added
by the project owner.

Each bonus must be:

At least a little useful (at your discretion)
Well implemented and 100% functional
